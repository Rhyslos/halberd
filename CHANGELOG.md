## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project foundations: Cargo workspace with 17 single-purpose crates in five layers.
- `layer-check` tool whose tests enforce the architecture rules on every change.
- Workspace-wide safety lints: no `unsafe` code, no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in library code, documentation required on every public item.
- Continuous integration: formatting, lint, tests and docs on Windows, Linux and macOS; license and vulnerability audit; downloadable builds for all three platforms; changelog check on pull requests.
- API reference published to GitHub Pages from `main`.
- Documentation: README with progress tracker, architecture overview, contributing guide, security policy, decision records, pull request and issue templates.
- `halberd` program skeleton that reports its version. When started by double-clicking, it waits for Enter so the message can be read.
- Downloaded builds open straight to the program, with no nested folders.
